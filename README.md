# Hey 👋

I’m **Eduardo Abdala**, an **Embedded Systems Engineer** with a strong focus on **research and academic development**.  
I currently work at **Perto S.A.**, developing solutions involving **firmware, low-level software, and hardware–software integration**.

My main academic interest lies in understanding and improving embedded systems from both **hardware and software perspectives**, with special attention to **security, performance, and real-world constraints**.

---

## 🎓 Academic Path

- **Master’s Degree (MSc) in Computer Science / Engineering** — **UFRGS** *(in progress / planned)*  
- **Research Area:** Embedded Systems Security  
- **Research Project:**  
  **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) in Embedded Systems**

My research focuses on the **implementation, evaluation, and optimization of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms** on resource-constrained embedded platforms, analyzing:
- Performance (latency, memory, energy)
- Practical feasibility on microcontrollers
- Trade-offs between security and system constraints

The goal is to contribute to **secure embedded architectures** resilient to future quantum attacks.
